# Steps to Commit

1) **fork** and **clone** the Repository:
   - clone: to clone a repository is to create an exact copy of that original repo. This includes all files, branches and even the 'commit history'.
   - fork: 'forking' a repository' is typically done on a hosting platform, such as GitHub. This permits you to create your own, personal copy. Any changes/alterations made will only effect your specific copy
   
    git clone https://github.com/mukesh-srivastav/FirstTimersOnly.git
    cd FirstTimersOnly


3) Create a **branch**:
      - **branch** When you create a "branch", you are ultimately diverging from the "main" line or "master" branch in order to work on a particular set of changes you're attempting to implement.*
   
   git checkout -b <branch-name>


4) Save Content/Code to Specified Folder


5) Now, **commit** Your Change

    git add -A
    git commit -m "(provide a brief description of what you have changed/fixed)"
    git push -u origin (branch name)


6) Go and open a pull request from your fork to the master branch of this repository.
